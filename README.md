# Practice Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch
The code is orgnized based on the OpenAI gym environments. Each solver consists of two files: `model.py/lib.py` and `run.py`. They are self-contained and do not depend on other py files.

`model.py/lib.py` contains the model definitions and some util functions. `run.py` runs the model in the gym envrionments. It has three sections: hyperparameters and initilization, training loop and evaluation loop. 

I usually run the `run.py` in Spyder IDE that supports section-based execution. After running the training loop in Spyder, I run the evaluation loop to visualize and evaluate the result.

I think this way of orgnaization is most friendly to beginners in RL and simpler than the way the spinningup code is strucutured.
